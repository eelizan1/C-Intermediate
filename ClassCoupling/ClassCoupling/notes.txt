Class Coupling

A measure of how interconnected classes and subsystems are

Tightly Coupled - Where many classes are dependent on each other
Loose Coupled - (Ideal software) Want to minimize changes in our application
				When we change a class, we want that change to be isolated
				Don't want that change to affect other parts of the application

How to Design a Loose Couples App? 
	1. Encapsulation
	2. Relationship between classes 
	3. Interfaces

Relationships Types
	1. Inheritance
	2. Composition
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inheritance

- A kind of relationship between two classes that allows one to inherit code from another
- referred to as 'Is-A'
- Example: A car is a vehical

Benefits: 
	Code re-use
	Polymorphic behavior

Parent/Base Class provides code that the child/Dervived class can use
